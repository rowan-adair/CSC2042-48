# CSC2042 Team48 (Note : This read me will be updated and completed this week)
Repository for Team 48 scripts, documentation and any other useful files/links.
For tracking progress as we'll be using the trello board (https://trello.com/b/elB5Nmiz/csc2042-team-48).

# Software You Will Need
I'd reccomend installing MySQL Workbench to work with and test any of the scripts. I'd also reccomend installing a good text editor so you don't always have to use MySQL Workbench. Something like Visual Studio Code or Submlime Text. Finally; everyone will need to install git to work with this repo and work further on the project. The list of download links are below.
- MySQL Workbench : https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
- Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Git : https://git-scm.com/downloads

# Initializing Local Repo
If anyone doesn't know how to use git bash yet it's okay :D. This article is pretty great and clear for a guide on how to use git bash : https://www.sitereq.com/post/easiest-way-to-install-git-bash-commands-on-windows.

When adding this repo to your own pc, open git bash in the chosen directory and write the commands in the following order.

`git init` 

`git remote add origin https://github.com/rowan-adair/CSC2042Team48.git`

`git remote -v`

`git pull`

# Scripts
Push any commits to the appropriate files. Keep to the four files established.
- createdb48.sql
- cleandb48.sql
- insertdb48.sql
- querydb48.sql

# Report
We'll be using one file, report48.doc.

When this file is ready for submission it will be saved as a pdf file.
