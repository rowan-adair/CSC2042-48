# Cloning Repo
If anyone doesn't know how to use git bash yet it's okay :D. This article is pretty great and clear for a guide on how to use git bash : https://www.sitereq.com/post/easiest-way-to-install-git-bash-commands-on-windows.

When adding this repo to your own pc, open git bash in the chosen directory and write the commands in the following order.

`git init` 

`git remote add origin remote repository URL`

`git remote -v`


# Scripts
Push any commits to the appropriate files. Keep to the four files established.
- createdb48.sql
- cleandb48.sql

- querydb48.sql

# Report
We'll be using one file, report48.doc.

When this file is ready for submission it will be saved as a pdf file.
